Building an R Shiny dashboard to visualize student data alongside a 
geographical map showing various locations in Cebu City was an interesting and 
welcoming experience.

One meaningful insight discovered based on the scatter plot is that 
study hours show no strong correlation with attendance,
while the box plot reveals that January has the highest and most variable 
Science scores compared to other months, suggesting that academic performance 
varies across months without a clear relationship to study behavior.

One significant visualization challenge encountered was rendering 
the Philippine map accurately using leaflet because projected shapefile for 
Philippine administrative boundaries proved to be more difficult than expected 
since mismatched coordinate reference systems caused
several provinces to render out of place or overlap incorrectly.

Despite the technical challenges we faced, the final dashboard has successfully 
shown its interactivity and readability, allowing users to properly locate 
important landmarks in Cebu City along with importance levels depending on
each landmark when using the geographical map window or visualizing study hours and
attendance from a student dataset, dynamically updating all 
three graphs in real time.

Overall, this project has proved to us how powerful R Shiny can be 
as a tool for communicating data-driven insights, especially when working with 
relevant and geographically grounded datasets.
